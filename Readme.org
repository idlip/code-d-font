#+title: OnePiece Fan's Recursive Font


* Fork
This is obviously a fork of ~Recursive Fonts~ , I have nerd-font patched it for icons, and have named it in a OnePiece fashion.
If you had noticed, all my personal repo's branched are named after OnePiece stuffs.

You can check the [[https://github.com/arrowtype/recursive-code-config][origianl repo]] and modify to your needs.

* Usage

Since I use *NixOS*, I got error on =libstdc++.s0.6= .

#+begin_src shell
  nix develop # or nix-shell -p gcc_multi

  # check for /nix/store/***-glib-2.76.2/lib64
  # Gets rid of libstdc++.so.6 error
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/nix/store/***-glib-2.76.2/lib64

  # Skip if done
  python -m venv venv
  pip install -r requirements.txt 

  # Follow on
  source venv/bin/activate
  python scripts/instantiate-code-fonts.py premade-configs/any.yaml
#+end_src


* Patch

Get the ~nerd-font-patcher~ from nerd-fonts repo.
| Nerd command | Usage                         |
| =-c=           | Complete Icon Set             |
| =--careful=    | Not to override present glyph |
| =--makegroups= | Renaming of font              |
| =-out=       | Output directory              |

Eg: In makegroups, -1 does not add any new name. It gives the default name as you built.
Rest all from 0-6, adds some form of name.

+ Before proceding, do a test with just a single file, like ~nerd-font-patcher this.ttf~

#+begin_src shell
  nerd-font-patcher -c --careful --makegroups -1 -out nerdy this.ttf

  # or in loop
  for i in *.ttf; do nerd-font-patcher -c --careful --makegroups -1 -out nerds $i; done
#+end_src


* Emacs

Use it in the GOAT-Editor!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "Rec Code Guest" :weight 'medium :height 150)

  ;; Set the fixed pitch face (monospace)
  (set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch nil :family "Rec Code Guest" :height 150)

  ;; Set the variable pitch face (document text)
  (set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch nil :family "Rec Code Casual" :height 170 :weight 'medium)


  # or you can also do

  (custom-set-faces
   '(default nil :family "Rec Code Guest" :weight 'medium :height 150)

   ;; Set the fixed pitch face (monospace)
   '(fixed-pitch nil :family "Rec Code Guest" :height 150)

   ;; Set the variable pitch face (document text)
   '(variable-pitch nil :family "Rec Code Casual" :height 170 :weight 'medium))
#+end_src
