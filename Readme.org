#+title: OnePiece Fan's Recursive Font

*Note:* Don't confuse with number of commits ahead of parent repo, there is no changes or development in font.

All commits are for readme (org file), font files, some nixos tweaking and renaming in script.

But surely if there are any commits in parent repo, I will merge/add it here.

* Fork
This is obviously a fork of ~Recursive Fonts~ , I have nerd-font patched it for icons, and have named it in a OnePiece fashion.
If you had noticed, all my personal repo's branched are named after OnePiece stuffs.

You can check the [[https://github.com/arrowtype/recursive-code-config][origianl repo]] and modify to your needs.

* Usage

Since I use *NixOS*, I got error on =libstdc++.s0.6= .

#+begin_src shell
  nix develop # or nix-shell -p gcc_multi

  # check for /nix/store/***-glib-2.76.2/lib64
  # Gets rid of libstdc++.so.6 error
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/nix/store/***-glib-2.76.2/lib64

  # Skip if done
  python -m venv venv
  pip install -r requirements.txt 

  # Follow on
  source venv/bin/activate
  python scripts/instantiate-code-fonts.py premade-configs/any.yaml
#+end_src


* Patch

Get the ~nerd-font-patcher~ from nerd-fonts repo.
| Nerd command | Usage                         |
| =-c=           | Complete Icon Set             |
| =--careful=    | Not to override present glyph |
| =--makegroups= | Renaming of font              |
| =-out=       | Output directory              |

Eg: In makegroups, -1 does not add any new name. It gives the default name as you built.
Rest all from 0-6, adds some form of name.

+ Before proceding, do a test with just a single file, like ~nerd-font-patcher this.ttf~

#+begin_src shell
  nerd-font-patcher -c --careful --makegroups -1 -out nerdy this.ttf

  # or in loop
  for i in *.ttf; do nerd-font-patcher -c --careful --makegroups -1 -out nerds $i; done
#+end_src


* Emacs

Use it in the GOAT-Editor!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "Rec Code Guest" :weight 'medium :height 150)

  ;; Set the fixed pitch face (monospace)
  (set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch nil :family "Rec Code Guest" :height 150)

  ;; Set the variable pitch face (document text)
  (set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch nil :family "Rec Code Casual" :height 170 :weight 'medium)


  # or you can also do

  (custom-set-faces
   '(default nil :family "Rec Code Guest" :weight 'medium :height 150)

   ;; Set the fixed pitch face (monospace)
   '(fixed-pitch nil :family "Rec Code Guest" :height 150)

   ;; Set the variable pitch face (document text)
   '(variable-pitch nil :family "Rec Code Casual" :height 170 :weight 'medium))
#+end_src

* Nix Package
I have made up an custom package for this fork.
You can use it by adding the line ~(pkgs.callPackage ./pkgs/recursive-font.nix {})~

#+begin_src nix
  { lib, fetchgit, stdenvNoCC }:

  stdenvNoCC.mkDerivation rec {
    pname = "code-d-font";
    version = "1.085";

    src = fetchgit {
      url = "https://github.com/idlip/code-d-font";
      sparseCheckout = [
	"fonts"
      ];
      # change the sha256 to latest one. Just uncomment the line, nix will give the latest sha value
      sha256 = "sha256-PkJOX+zYQYs0J+T92y4oTXsYXKJ960/TSELDjykw52Q=";
    };

    installPhase = ''
      install -D -t $out/share/fonts/truetype/ $(find $src -type f -name '*.ttf')
    '';


    meta = with lib; {
      homepage = "https://github.com/arrowtype/recursive-code-config/";
      description = "A variable font family for code & UI";
      license = licenses.ofl;
      maintainers = [ maintainers.idlip ];
      platforms = platforms.all;
    };
  }
